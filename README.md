# Software Architecture Global Currency

## Introduction
This repository contains the software architecture documentation of Global Currency described using the [C4 DSL](https://c4model.com/) and the [structurizr toolset](https://structurizr.com/)

## Getting Started

Please check out this repository and modify the existing documentation via a standard "Pull request" flow.

To render the diagrams most conveniently use strcuturizr lite (started in the diagram directory using docker)

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v ${PWD}:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite
```

## Current development

Currently the trust system is in development.

A first preview is available at [trust](https://trust.global-currency.org/). You need an account at [gravatar](https://grvatar.com/) to play around. Your email must end with ".de" otherwise your email is always invalid.
